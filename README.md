# Melius Artis
That's latin for better craft.
I don't always like te textures in mods, so here is my attempt at making them slightly better.
Eventually I also want to make all the textures between all the mods look consistent, but that might take a while.
If you think my (well, not all of them are mine) textures are not better, that's fine and please tell me why you think that. The goal of this pack is to have better textures.

If you would like to help me with this, please do! If you have a github account you can fork it and make a pull request when you're done. If you don't have a github account you can send me some textures in a private message and tell me where to put them.

# Credits
Here are some credits to people who have helped:

Baddaspig made metallurgy style textures for the broadsword and longsword.

And of course thanks to all the modders who made these great mods and the people that made the original textures for the mods, I only made their textures slightly better.
